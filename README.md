Indexing Project
This project was developed as part of the Data Structures course at the University of Fortaleza (UNIFOR), specifically for the final AV3 exam.

Project Description
The project consists of a program that reads a text file and generates an index of keywords found in the text, indicating the lines where each word appears. The main functionalities of the project include:

- File Reading: Reads a text file (texto.txt) and a keyword file (palavras-chave.txt).
- Data Structures: Utilizes various data structures, such as binary search trees and linked lists, to store and manipulate words and their respective lines.
- Index Generation: Creates a file (linhas_palavras.txt) that contains each keyword followed by the lines where it appears in the text.

Data Structures Used
- Binary Search Tree: To store words in an ordered and efficient manner.
- Linked List: To maintain the lines where each word appears.
- Hash Table: To quickly index the keywords.

Project Files
- src/Main.java: Main source code of the project.
- src/linhas_palavras.txt: Generated file with the index.
- src/palavras-chave.txt: List of keywords to be indexed.
- src/texto.txt: Input text for which the index will be generated.

How to Run
Clone the repository.
Compile the Main.java file.
Run the program providing the input text files.
